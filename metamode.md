<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Supplementary figures for Multiobjective evolutionary algorithm work</h1>

Multiobjective evolutionary algorithm allows more accurate genome-scale fluxes simulations with a handful experimental values

Keywords: metabolic modelling, nonlinear optimization, Synechocystis sp. PCC6803
<h2>Pareto fronts of cyanobacterial optimizations</h2>
X axis: Growth (h-1)
Y axis: Total sum of fluxes
Z axis: Deviation from experimental fluxes
Color is the weighted distance to minimum similarity-parsimony
Red points are the five Pareto points used for our analyses, which have the lowest combinations of total sum of fluxes (parsimony, Y axis), deviations from experimental fluxes (similarity, Z axis) and weighted distance to the combined minimum similarity-parsimony.
